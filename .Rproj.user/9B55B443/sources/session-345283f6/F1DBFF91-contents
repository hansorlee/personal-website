# Stanford Brand Demo - Quarto

This repository shows an implementation of [Stanford's identity guidelines][suidg] with [Quarto][qmain] using the new [`brand.yml` specification][byml] in [Quarto pre-release v1.6][qbyml] This provides a reusable way for creating consistent Stanford-branded academic and technical content across different output formats including HTML documents, RevealJS presentations, Typst documents, and dashboards.

> [!NOTE]
>
> This demo is using a **pre-release** version of Quarto 1.6 and the `brand.yml` specification. The final release may have changes to the specification and implementation.
> If you wish to use this in your own projects, please make sure you have a [pre-release version of Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/download/prerelease.html) and refer to the official documentation for the latest information.

## Overview

The demo showcases Stanford's identity guidelines through different Quarto documents:

- HTML
- RevealJS
- Typst
- Dashboard

> [!NOTE]
>
> This demo is based on the [Example Brand Demo](https://github.com/cwickham/quarto-examples/tree/brand/brand/brand-simple) by Charlotte Wickham discussed in the [Quarto Branding Documentation][qbyml].

### Requirements

- [Quarto][qmain] > 1.6.32 (pre-release)

## Structure

```
.
├── README.md          # This documentation
├── _brand.yml         # Stanford brand specifications
├── _quarto.yml        # Quarto project configuration
└── index.qmd          # Example document
```

## Brand Implementation

The [`_brand.yml` file][byml] defines Stanford's visual identity elements:

- Cardinal Red as primary color
- Cool Grey as secondary color
- Source Sans Pro and Source Serif Pro fonts
- Spacing and layout guidelines
- Custom color variants and tints

Example from `_brand.yml`:

```yaml
color:
   palette:
      cardinal: "#8C1515"
      white: "#FFFFFF"
      process-black: "#2E2D29"
  
   foreground: process-black
   background: white
   primary: cardinal
```

We register the brand configuration in the project's `_quarto.yml` with:

```yaml
brand: _brand.yml
```

We've also defined custom override to the navigation bar background color in the `_brand.yml`:

```yaml
defaults:
  bootstrap:
    navbar-bg: $brand-cardinal
```

This will change the navigation bar background color to Cardinal Red, which is the primary color in Stanford's identity guidelines and is [the default color for a navigation bar](https://identity.stanford.edu/digital/web-design/brand-compliance/).

> [!NOTE]

> This specification may change in the final release of 
> Quarto's brand-yml support. Please refer to the official 
> documentation for the latest information.
